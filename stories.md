  One of my friend runs a Gas Industry.There they follow the traditional way of maintaing the records in physical books(like ledgers)
  moreover the billing was done maually. the worst part is , as it is a industry bussiness many customers pays bills monthly though 
  they take deliveries of gas cylinders on regular basis. This was making difficult for searching manually evey record of that month.
  and calculating the bills for with and without GST was little hectic task
  
  So to overcome all the above stated problrms and to automate most of the things this portal was designed.
  
   WHAT ALL THINS THIS PROJECT CLAIMS::
   --regular entry of customers
   --adding new long term customer to make GST bills
   --keeing simple record for regular and daily customers
   --Entering every details involving madetory and optional fields of customers
   --every record of the customer is stored in database with time 
   --depending upon the quantity of the different cylinders of gases the bill will be generated
   --PDF of the bill be generated to give a print and optinally the soft copy will be shared to customers via email/whatsapp
   --monthly bill will be calculated .. and new bill be generated every month
